# Customer_churn_prediction
This project involved predicting customer retention using the Online Retail dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project involved several steps, including data preparation, feature engineering, model selection and training, and model evaluation and interpretation. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed, missing values were handled, and irrelevant variables were filtered out. New features such as frequency of purchases, recency of purchases, and monetary value of purchases were created. The target variable was a binary variable indicating whether a customer had made a purchase in the last 3-6 months. Logistic regression algorithm was selected to train the model, and its performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model's coefficients or feature importances were interpreted to understand the factors that were most important for predicting customer retention. The model was then used to predict customer retention on new data and identify which customers were at risk of churning.
